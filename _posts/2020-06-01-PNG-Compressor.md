I have tried an excellent PNG file compressor online: [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
Usually this can compress a figure by about 60% without lossing visually detectable quality!
This should always be used whenever possible.

Unlike JPEG, PNG doesn't typically have a lossy compression scheme. What they can achieve is something I haven't really found an alternative for.

I made a donation of $5 to them. Great work!

- `ffmpeg` has some built-in compressor when combining figures into movies, so it make less sense to compress each figure before passing them to `ffmpeg`.
