## Basic Math Tools

[Einstein notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation)

[Covariance and contravariance of vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors)

There is a simple [example](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/666246/tensor-einstein-summation-notation) for superscript and subscript. A simple rule is that **subscripts represent row vectors and superscripts represent column vectors.**

Degree of freedom:

* symmetry of 3x3 tensor --> 6
* traceless: \\( g_{ii} = 0 \\) --> 5

Make analogies of what you don't know to what you know.
