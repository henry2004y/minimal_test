I am glad to see the evolving of modern shells. I enjoy using zsh, but now there are even fancier ones: [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/). It highlights three features:

* cross-platform: works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows
* everything is data: Nu pipelines use structured data so you can safely select, filter, and sort the same way every time. Stop parsing strings and start solving problems.
* extensibility: it's easy to extend Nu using a powerful plugin system.

From what I can tell by reading the documentation, scripting in nu is like programming in a compiled language. The developers of nu are ambitious: they want to incorporate some parts of data processing into a shell, but the question is, is it worth to rely on a shell language instead of a more powerful language for data analysis?

Anyway, it already feels like an exciting CLI tool to use. And it is written in Rust!
